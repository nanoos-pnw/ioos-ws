# ioos-ws
NANOOS implementation of IOOS-compliant web services. A repository for documentation and issue tracking.

## Some notes on ncISO and related topics (eg, THREDDS configuration for time series)

- Our [issue #2](https://github.com/nanoos-pnw/ioos-ws/issues/2)
- https://github.com/ioos/catalog/tree/master/waf_generation_scripts. From NERACOOS THREDDS crawaling examples. See also http://www.neracoos.org/thredds/UMO_SOS_historical_realtime_agg.xml for some potentially helpful examples of aggregating historical and NRT time series data
- https://github.com/ioos/registry/wiki/Hosting-Your-Own-WAF. This repo will probably go away, though, to be replaced by content on https://ioos.github.io/catalog/
